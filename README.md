# Final-Year-Project
Defence Entrance Security System

Army security system is a project through which the official works of armed forces can be protected.
The use of this system is to provide surveillance 24/7. The main aim of our project is to allow only the authorized 
person inside armed forces work field. One of the biggest advantages of this is that manpower required for checking 
will be very less and it saves our time. In First stage we use an android application as a first level of security. Along 
with the android application, we are using facial recognition for which the data about army members will be collected 
before and when they try to go through this biometric process, the system authorizes them if at all their data is been 
stored before in the database of the system. Upcoming stage is the interface which includes ultrasonic sensor, speaker, 
keypad, lcd display and solenoid lock with relay for the opening of the door.
